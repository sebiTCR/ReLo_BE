# ReLo (Back-end) 

ReLo is a simple project with the scope of learning how to make a login/register form. In this project, the main learning points are 
   * Learning how to use Express as an efficient REST API.
   * How to use MongoDB with CRUD operations
   * How to handle HTML Forms

## Important!
  This includes only the REST API used by the project. To test the entire app, please clone [Relo FE](https://github.com/DanetDaniel/ReLo_FE), which is the FrontEnd   part used by this project
